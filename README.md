  ParelPracht
</h1>

ParelPracht is the successor of Goudglans, the custom Customer Relation Management system of Study Association GEWIS.
This new system is built during the second lockdown of the corona pandemic.
Its main goal is to automate tedious tasks and to keep a clear and concise overview of the current collaborations.
This is achieved by creating nice structured insights tables and graphs and automating the generation of contracts, proposals and invoices.

This is the back-end of ParelPracht. [The front-end can be found here](https://github.com/GEWIS/parelpracht-client).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill / replace the keys with their corresponding values. Note that the email-keys
   are important to be able to install the application (see step 5).
4. Run `npm run dev`. This runs the client in development mode. Node will bind to port `3001`. You can find the API
   documentation at [http://localhost:3001/api/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:3001/api/swagger-ui/).
5. Make a POST-request to `/v1/setup` with your credentials. The required payload can be found in the Swagger
   documentation. This request will create a local administrator account with the given credentials. You will receive an
   email (on the given address via the given mail server at step 3) to set your password.
6. In the `VAT` table, add the desired VAT categories and percentages.

You can also build the application with `npm run build`. This puts a production build in the `./build` directory.

## Deployment
1. Clone the repository in a folder called `parelpracht-client` and clone the backend repository in a folder called `parelpracht-server`. Make sure that both folders are in the same parent folder.
2. Change the image locations to the correct locations in `docker-compose.yml` (for both the frontend and backend).
3. Fill in the correct (environment) variables in `docker-compose.yml`.
4. Run `docker-compose` in `./parelpracht-client`.
